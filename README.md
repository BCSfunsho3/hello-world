Hello Humans!
I found how to connect with the creator of the universe
It is by believing on the name of the son of God: His name is Jesus Christ who was crucfied and died for our offences so that we do not have to die. He not only died he was buried and on the tiord day  the almighty God even the Father, raised him from the dead for our justification or complete acquittal of all our past sins
If you want to know the true meaning of life and to  connect with creator of the universe. you must have your sins forgiven and completly blotted out; just pray a short prayer right now and say Lord Jesus I am sorry for my sins, I believe the word of God that you died for me and your rose up from the dead for my justifcation, thank you  so much you for dying for my sins , please come into my heart now and save me, Amen.
